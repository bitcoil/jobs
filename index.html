			<p>
Ever since early 2011, <a href="http://bitcoil.co.il/">Bitcoil</a> has been the heart of Bitcoin in Israel. It offered everyone an easy way to get their hands on some bitcoins, and its founders, Meni Rosenfeld and Ron Gross, have pioneered the local community and have been the undisputed experts in the field.</p>
		  
<p>With the explosive growth of Bitcoin adoption in recent months, our vision is still to be the leading provider of Bitcoin services in Israel - starting with the exchange service, and continuing with many other interesting projects on our pipeline. But the work required to make this happen is too great for just us two to lead it - we lack both the time to complete our numerous tasks, and some skills for interacting effectively with the "old world". We wish to expand our core team - and this is where you come in.
</p>

<p>We are looking for a <strong>Chief Operating Officer</strong>, <strong>co-founder</strong> and <strong>partner</strong> in Bitcoil. As a COO, you will take ownership of the operational aspects of building and running the company's projects. You will be a key partner in the company, work with us to make stuff happen and help Israeli customers make the most of the digital currency world.</p>

<p><strong>Job Requirements</strong>: </p>


<ol>
<li>Management experience, for example as a CEO or COO of a similar company.</li>
<li>Experience with communicating effectively with lawyers, accountants, bankers and similar service providers; business development and negotiation skills.</li>
<li>Passion for Bitcoin and other revolutionary forms of currency. We think Bitcoin is the best thing since sliced bread, and so should you.</li>
<li>Desire to be part of an elite team making a big impact, take ownership of projects, initiate creative ideas and get things done.</li>
</ol>

<p>If this sounds like you, we will be excited to receive your resume at jobs@bitcoil.co.il.</p>
